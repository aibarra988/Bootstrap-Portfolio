                My name is Abraham Ibarra. I am from El Paso, TX and 
                I've been living in Austin since 2012. Some of my 
                favorite hobbies are tinkering with technology, 
                skateboarding, and cooking. I love going to shows in 
                town and traveling to national parks across the US. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As far as I can remember, I've been fascinated by 
                computers, video games and problem solving. I knew my calling
                was to be a developer. After 
                serving in the US Navy for four years, I've gained five 
                years in the IT industry; three of which I have been a 
                software developer at CA Technologies working on the IDaaS 
                platform CA Identity Service. 
            </p>

            <p>
                During my time at CA Technologies, I was left hungry to keep 
                growing as a software engineer. My goal
                is to always keep working towards writing clean and useful code 
                while keeping in mind the hardships and lessons that come from working on 
                a dense codebase with brittle tests. One big lesson I learned: always write
                tests. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                I enjoyed being able to contribute 
                to working in all of the components of our tech stack and 
                participate in designing and developing new features.
                I made the time to sharpen my skills and grow my network 
                by going to The Coding Boot Camp at the University of Texas 
                so that I could feel more confident when interviewing for 
                my next position.
