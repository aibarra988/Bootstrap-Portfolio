                            My name is Abraham Ibarra. I am from El Paso, TX and I've been living in Austin since 2012. Some of my favorite hobbies are
                            tinkering with technology, skateboarding, and cooking. I love going to shows in town and traveling
                            to national parks across the US.

                            As far as I can remember, I've been fascinated by computers, video games and problem solving. I knew my calling was to be
                            a developer. After serving in the US Navy for four years, I've gained five years in the IT industry;
                            three of which I have been a software developer at CA Technologies working on the IDaaS platform
                            CA Identity Service.

                            During my time at CA Technologies, I was left hungry to keep growing as a software engineer. My goal is to always keep working
                            towards writing clean and useful code while keeping in mind the hardships and lessons that come
                            from working on a dense codebase with brittle tests. One big lesson I learned: always write tests.
